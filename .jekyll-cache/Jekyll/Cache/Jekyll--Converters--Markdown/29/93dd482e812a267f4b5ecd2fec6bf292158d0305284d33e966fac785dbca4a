I"ÿ<p>Hi! My name is Courtney Tern. I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, pursuing a Distinguished Major in Human Biology and a B.A. in Mathematical Statistics.</p>

<p>My current career goal is to work in public health, with a particular interest in increasing diversity and accessibility to healthcare. Check out my ethics blog above!</p>

<p>I love music (a mix of classical and 90â€™s alt-rock), dancing (a mix of ballet and hip hop), and making jokes (a mix of bad and terrible).</p>
