## Hello!
  Welcome to my homepage. This is a personal website dedicated to documenting my professional projects, ethics blog, and digital resume. I coded this site based off of a Jekyll template with HTML and Markdown.

### About Me
  I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, pursuing a Distinguished Major in Human Biology and a B.A. in Mathematical Statistics.

  My current career goal is to work in public health, with a particular interest in increasing equity and accessibility in healthcare. Check out my ethics blog above!

  I love music (a mix of classical and 90's alt-rock), dancing (a mix of ballet and hip hop), and making jokes (a mix of bad and terrible).
