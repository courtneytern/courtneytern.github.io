## Bergland Lab
*2019-present* <br>
Currently, I am working on a project to study the evolutionary history of the model organism *Drosophila simulans* in North America. Using published whole-genome sequencing data from online databases, my aim is to discover the percentage that North American populations of *D. simulans* are admixed with European and African populations. <br>
<!-- I have also coded the lab website <a href="">here</a>, using the same skills that I use for this website! -->

#### Past projects
* Conducted a ten-month fecundity assay on *Drosophila melanogaster* samples to study plasticity vs adaptation
  - Adapted and tested a computer program to count eggs on an agar plate
  - Made 140 of the aforementioned agar plates every two weeks
  - Collected samples from a field site
* Maintained routine fly stocks


## Onengut Lab
*2020-present* <br>
I have just started at this lab, and I am in the learning and listening phase! I have been reading many papers about the genetic basis of Type 1 Diabetes in humans.
