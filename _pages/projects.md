   ### Bergland Lab
   *2019-present* <br>
   Currently, I am working on a project to study the evolutionary history of the model organism *Drosophila simulans* in North America. Using published whole-genome sequencing data from online databases, my aim is to discover the percentage that North American populations of *D. simulans* are admixed with European and African populations.

   ### Onengut Lab
   *2020-present* <br>
   I have just started at this lab, and I am in the learning and listening phase! I have been reading many papers about the genetic basis of Type 1 Diabetes in humans.
