## Bergland Lab
*2019-present* <br>
Currently, I am working on a project to study the evolutionary history of the model organism *Drosophila simulans* in North America. Using published whole-genome sequencing data from online databases, my aim is to study the evolutionary history of *D. simulans* in North America and its admixture with European and African populations. I have been teaching myself AWK and Bash for this project, and I work on UVa's high-performance computing system, Rivanna. <br>
I also code and maintain the Bergland lab website <a href="bergland-lab.org">here</a>!

#### Past projects
* Conducted a ten-month fecundity assay on *Drosophila melanogaster* samples to study plasticity vs adaptation
  - Adapted and tested a computer program to count Drosophila eggs on an agar plate
  - Made 140 of the aforementioned agar plates every two weeks
  - Collected samples from a field site
* Maintained routine fly stocks


## Onengut Lab
*2020-present* <br>
I have just started at this public health genomics lab, and I have been reading papers about the genetic basis of Type 1 Diabetes in humans. My goal is to study diverse genetic panels for my Human Biology DMP thesis.
